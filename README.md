## Description
A react application that works like a little black book for a user that wants to keep contacts in a location with a password to protect it. The user is also allowed to mark the contact as on "Fire" or on "Ice". 

Hello?
Hey hun, what’s up, what are you doing?
Not much, I was just hanging out and was thinking about everything going on. I’m so excited to start dating again.
RIGHT?!? Getting back out there.
Yeah, but I’m having trouble keeping up with the people I’m dating. I went on this one date, and I kept not wanting to say the wrong name. I wish there were a way I could keep up with all these people I have connected with, but I don’t want them in just my phone or in the dating app.
LOL
So this thing came up on my IG called TABS. It’s supposed to handle all of that information for you. For example, you’re able to add cards, edit them, and delete them. Apparently, they created it for people like us who want a place to house all these contacts without them being out in the open on your phone! Like once you connect with someone, you can an entire card with their picture, name, location. I heard you can even add notes about them like that one guy you dated who we called the hipster bc he wouldn’t shut up about IPAs LOL. So far it’s easy to use—it’s my little black book on my phone ha ha ha
It’s so funny too bc if you’re not feeling someone for a bit, you can put them on ice or if you’re digging them, you can click the fire icon and it takes your faves to the top of your list. It’s like my fave new thing right now.
TABS is so reliable too. It’s created with MongoDB, Express js, React and Node. You have to create a login to view your contacts and it’s super safe with password authentication, so no need to worry about someone seeing your hunnies or exposing your contact list.
It runs concurrent servers so everything loads fast and beautifully. TBH, this app is pretty sexy. I heard that there was extensive testing with GraphQL too, whatever that means, but someone put in a lot of work.

## License
This application is covered under MIT.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Tests
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
